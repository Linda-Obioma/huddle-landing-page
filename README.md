- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a lot in this project, most especially the adding of icons to my webpage using ionicons.com. Also the use of border and border-radius to add a circle round the icons.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<button>Register</button>
```

```css
.proud-of-these-css {
  flex-direction: column;
  color: var(--white);
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to use css flexbox and css grid more in future because I still have a lot to learn in them. I will also learn more on other features and how to apply some of them.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This site helped me a lot in most of my researches especially in css. It's a very good open source to learn coding and I be using it more often.
